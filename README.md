Our App supports the development of life skills using stories and curiosity-driven learning by allowing users to learn as their curiosity takes them and get rewarded for effective learning and being curious. 

A good use case will be: a student selects the story of Yaksha and Yudhishthir, where after seeing the entire story, the learner has the choice to decide what to learn next based upon the story and curiosity, in the above example he can understand how to be calm and composed like Yudhishthira in tough situations, or understand how to ask intelligent questions like Yaksha or know why humans give in to rage and behave as the first four Pandavas did. 
This gives us a tree-like structure with multiple branches and equal end nodes, the platform will function on an algorithm to balance out the biased learning at the same time allowing them to learn cross-discipline skills. Upon going in further depth, as the area of interest gets more clear on the learner's part, the platform will also unlock more of such similar stories. 
As we believe in rewarding the ability to stay curious, users will be receiving surprise rewards when they ask questions which we haven't already listed or stay focused in a particular genre and many more such reward domains. We also aim to improve parent-child relationship dynamics and hence we will give the option to learners to send the learning updates to parents once a week. So when the child opts for the update to the parent, they will receive a message that will look like-

*`Your Child has learned about emotional intelligence from the stories of Yaksha and Yudhishthir, and few fables of Lord Buddha`*. 


Further, we aim to integrate systems that can help parents to better understand where their child is naturally inclined in learning and provide additional services if they wish to understand probable career paths with the inclined learning. As the entire platform is intensive on the current and past behavior of users, data handing will be a critical part of the project and hence we aim to ensure complete privacy and security by use of encryption at all the needed ends.

On the whole, we aim to develop a solution that can bridge societal gaps by means of education and using tech as a tool.
